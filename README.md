# HTML Lists Assignment
Create a boilerplate html5 page.

- unordered list - *at least 3 skills you have*
- level 3 heading `<h3>` - *experience*

## Run tests locally as much as possible (only use Github Action for limited testing and final submission)
You can run the tests locally by running `npm install`, then `npm test` in the terminal. Go to [Node.js home page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) for more information on installing npm and Node.js
